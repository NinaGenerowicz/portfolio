# 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Nina

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a **Power BI Developer** and **Business Analyst** with a strong background in data visualization, automation, and process optimization. My work involves transforming raw data into actionable insights and streamlining business processes with automation tools.  

- 🔹 **Power BI** – Building interactive dashboards, optimizing DAX measures, and working with complex data models.  
- 🔹 **RPA & Process Analysis** – Designing and documenting automation workflows, identifying inefficiencies, and collaborating with developers to implement solutions.  
- 🔹 **Microsoft Visio** – Mapping out business processes and automation flows.  
- 🔹 **Power Platform** – Creating **Power Apps** for simple business applications and designing basic **Power Automate** workflows for process automation.  

🧠 In addition to the examples featured in this portfolio, I’ve developed a wide range of dashboards across different business functions. These have included solutions for **HR** teams tracking performance and compliance-related tasks, **operational** dashboards supporting invoice and vendor master data processes, as well as monitoring tools for **error logs and exception handling.** While these projects aren’t publicly shareable, they reflect the same principles of clarity, automation-awareness, and business impact found in my portfolio work.

These dashboards focused on process visibility, exception handling, data accuracy, and operational efficiency — all designed with business users in mind.
